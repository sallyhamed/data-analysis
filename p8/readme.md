## Dataset

> The dataset we will be using is the Ford GoBike System Data. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The dataset can be found  (https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca78b26_dataset-project-communicate-data-findings/dataset-project-communicate-data-findings.pdf).

## Summary of Findings

> This analysis purpose is to find the factors that can increase the usage of bike share. The study will be in the following aspects:
The duration of using shared bikes per person.
The  distance on using shared bikes per person.
With different user type, genders, and age groups what is the  effect on usagebike share.
After exploring the above fields , we found out:
Most people would consider using the bikes when the trip is less than 1.25 kilometers.
On average, a user did a ride in no more than 11.15 minutes.
The duration and distance shows a very low correlation
The customer has a higher average duration than the subsriber.
Young people are likely to use the bike for a long duration.
The distribution of duration for different people is nearly the same.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most users choose to use the bike share when the trips are quick and not too far away. I think if we increase new stations every 1.25kilometers we will increase the usage of bike share.

>Young people are likely to use the bike for a long duration.
>the customer has a higher duration.It would be great ifwe provide servieces like map to make trip easer and shorter for customer to be subscriber.
>male subscribers are more than female subscribers, so we can make offers and make bikes in bright colors to attract all customers especially women to subscribe.
>Ford GoBike need to take marketing efforts to attract customers to become subscribers.
